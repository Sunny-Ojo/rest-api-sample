# This is just to demonstrate how i would create a restful API if i were to build one, however i would prefer creating a helper class to return json responses

So a restful api also contains the right status codes as well

## The api.php file is assummed to be the api.php file in the routes folder of laravel and also requests will have prefixs of /api/admin/end-point

### Also the routes were created following the laravel 8 route::controller method

#### The UsersController file contains how the methods of a restful API can be created
